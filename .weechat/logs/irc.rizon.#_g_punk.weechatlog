He was released on his own recognizance after bail was set at $20,000.[28][29]

2017-08-21 09:57:10	Alefret	so with distros you have to trust certain package managers but the appeal of slackware is that you can chose?
2017-08-21 09:57:57	t_f	no, the appeal is that the central packages that are managed by the first party slackware are maintained so that every fresh install will just werk nearly every time on any hardware

2017-08-21 10:01:12	t_f	slackware is the slow and steady tortoise, arch is the bleeding edge rabbit 
2017-08-21 10:01:12	t_f	that's what makes them opposites

2017-08-21 23:38:47	cazum	but then you fall into analogous problems like you have now with protected religion status. Sure, the individual believers of the religion might not all think that imposing shariah law is good (or, not all PHP devs think that "42" == 42 is good practice), but with that said, some do, and so, criticizing the religion (or programming language, PHP) should be fair game.
2017-08-21 23:38:47	t_f	they see us laughin

2017-08-21 23:39:48	cazum	of course the ultra tolerant morons arent able to distinguish between the two, and so you have "anti-islamaphobia" motions passed in canadian government, and now this dipshit who thinks its offensive to say that PHP is a piece of shit

2017-08-25 11:54:11	Reaver	lcy: Depends, but I've noticed a very real trend where Muslim professors will make ridiculous historical claims about Islam. I had one Muslim prof try to claim that Muslims invented the alphabet.

2017-08-25 11:55:37	Leper	its not an alphabet and not even the oldest
2017-08-25 11:55:58	Reaver	The Phoenicians had the first actual alphabet. The Egyptians were going in that direction, but still used highly symbolic language.
2017-08-25 11:56:04	+lcy	I thought that heiroglyphs became simplified to represent syllables and that's how the alphabet got its start
2017-08-25 11:56:11	Reaver	Long before Islam ever existed.

2017-08-26 23:52:33	+Politik	but gladiatorial combat was seen by every class in roman cities
2017-08-26 23:52:53	+Politik	there was seating for every class
2017-08-26 23:53:03	+Politik	from slaves to patricians

2017-08-26 23:53:20	+flipFLOPS	and guess which seating filled up to capacity every game and which didn't :^)
2017-08-26 23:53:26	+yossarian	it's a little more complicated than that, since gladiatorial combat wasn't actually that popular
2017-08-26 23:53:37	+yossarian	the races were much more popular
2017-08-26 23:54:45	+yossarian	the coliseums were mostly used for troop shows, mock battles, and beast fights
2017-08-26 23:55:25	+flipFLOPS	sounds really low-test to me, hahaha!

2017-08-27 00:00:14	+yossarian	it's a real shame, perception of roman culture has been seriously distorted by the fact that the coliseum was preserved while the circus wasn't

2017-08-27 00:01:13	Pimster	you can see the the ring where they rode
2017-08-27 00:01:23	+yossarian	Pimster: our actual physical evidence regarding the outfits and lifestyles of gladiators is very slim
2017-08-27 00:01:43	+yossarian	it's literally a dirt strip
2017-08-27 00:01:45	derive	they were black
2017-08-27 00:01:55	derive	just like the egyptians
2017-08-27 00:02:02	Pimster	also ben hur was all about racing, if you ask my grandpa about it he will likely tell you about riding instead of gladiators
2017-08-27 00:02:20	+yossarian	the only reason the coliseum was preserved is because it was a location of martyrdom
2017-08-27 00:02:59	+yossarian	same with a lot of other roman buildings, the ones that weren't associated with christian persecution were either destroyed or burnt for their marble
2017-08-27 00:04:24	+yossarian	Pimster: i'm not saying the races don't exist in popular conception, but compare ben hur (one 1950s movie) to countless movies about spartacus/gladiators, and shows/movies about rome that use the coliseum as backdrop
2017-08-27 00:06:04	Pimster	I agree it got dominant in popular culture
2017-08-27 00:06:18	Pimster	but I can't think of any before the gladiator, I haven't watched much anyway
2017-08-27 00:07:01	+flipFLOPS	brb posting on /pol/ about how the jewish controlled media is exacting a revenge for the martyrdom on romans through smear campaigns
2017-08-27 00:07:19	+yossarian	off the top of my head, that's one, plus Spartacus (1960s?), plus that awful HBO show about Spartacus
2017-08-27 00:07:32	Pimster	right there's spielberg spartacus
2017-08-27 00:07:36	Pimster	spielberg wtf

2017-08-27 00:07:49	+yossarian	yeah
2017-08-27 00:07:55	%GreyMan	so uh 
2017-08-27 00:07:57	+yossarian	that one was just low-key propaganda
2017-08-27 00:08:41	+yossarian	anyways i just think it's a pity, since so many people think of the romans as bloodthirsty maniacs
2017-08-27 00:08:41	Pimster	didn't like the caesar bits
2017-08-27 00:09:02	+yossarian	when in reality gladiatorial combat usually wasn't fatal, and was probably pretty close in severity and popularity to boxing in 2017
2017-08-27 00:09:04	derive	idk gladiators were p popular and fights went on for like 1000 years
2017-08-27 00:09:31	+yossarian	derive: they were "popular", in the same way that soccer and football are both popular in the US
2017-08-27 00:09:36	derive	yes
2017-08-27 00:09:40	derive	thats kind of the point
2017-08-27 00:09:58	+yossarian	but it wasn't *the* entertainment for romans
2017-08-27 00:10:06	+yossarian	which is how it gets portrayed; that was the races
2017-08-27 00:10:46	Pimster	tfw ywn be turned into an ass and fuck romans matronae after circus shoes
2017-08-27 00:10:48	Pimster	*shows
2017-08-27 00:10:59	+yossarian	and the fights didn't go on for a millenia; it's complicated. they started out as an etruscan burial tradition, and didn't become a public affair until mid republic IIRC

2017-08-27 00:12:17	+yossarian	gladiatorial games were around for a long time, but they weren't a public affair (or at least a major one) until they lost their association with death-games

It also safeguards against online foreign influence.
