He was released on his own recognizance after bail was set at $20,000.[28][29]

2017-08-21 09:57:10	Alefret	so with distros you have to trust certain package managers but the appeal of slackware is that you can chose?
2017-08-21 09:57:57	t_f	no, the appeal is that the central packages that are managed by the first party slackware are maintained so that every fresh install will just werk nearly every time on any hardware

2017-08-21 10:01:12	t_f	slackware is the slow and steady tortoise, arch is the bleeding edge rabbit

2017-08-21 23:38:47	cazum	but then you fall into analogous problems like you have now with protected religion status. Sure, the individual believers of the religion might not all think that imposing shariah law is good (or, not all PHP devs think that "42" == 42 is good practice), but with that said, some do, and so, criticizing the religion (or programming language, PHP) should be fair game.
2017-08-21 23:38:47	t_f	they see us laughin

2017-08-21 23:39:48	cazum	of course the ultra tolerant morons arent able to distinguish between the two, and so you have "anti-islamaphobia" motions passed in canadian government, and now this dipshit who thinks its offensive to say that PHP is a piece of shit

2017-08-25 11:54:11	Reaver	lcy: Depends, but I've noticed a very real trend where Muslim professors will make ridiculous historical claims about Islam. I had one Muslim prof try to claim that Muslims invented the alphabet.

2017-08-25 11:55:37	Leper	its not an alphabet and not even the oldest
2017-08-25 11:55:58	Reaver	The Phoenicians had the first actual alphabet. The Egyptians were going in that direction, but still used highly symbolic language.
2017-08-25 11:56:04	+lcy	I thought that heiroglyphs became simplified to represent syllables and that's how the alphabet got its start
2017-08-25 11:56:11	Reaver	Long before Islam ever existed.

2017-08-26 23:52:33	+Politik	but gladiatorial combat was seen by every class in roman cities
2017-08-26 23:52:53	+Politik	there was seating for every class

2017-08-26 23:53:20	+flipFLOPS	and guess which seating filled up to capacity every game and which didn't :^)
2017-08-26 23:53:26	+yossarian	it's a little more complicated than that, since gladiatorial combat wasn't actually that popular
2017-08-26 23:53:37	+yossarian	the races were much more popular
2017-08-26 23:54:45	+yossarian	the coliseums were mostly used for troop shows, mock battles, and beast fights
2017-08-26 23:55:25	+flipFLOPS	sounds really low-test to me, hahaha!

2017-08-27 00:00:14	+yossarian	it's a real shame, perception of roman culture has been seriously distorted by the fact that the coliseum was preserved while the circus wasn't

2017-08-27 00:01:13	Pimster	you can see the the ring where they rode
2017-08-27 00:01:23	+yossarian	Pimster: our actual physical evidence regarding the outfits and lifestyles of gladiators is very slim
2017-08-27 00:01:43	+yossarian	it's literally a dirt strip
2017-08-27 00:01:45	derive	they were black
2017-08-27 00:01:55	derive	just like the egyptians
2017-08-27 00:02:02	Pimster	also ben hur was all about racing, if you ask my grandpa about it he will likely tell you about riding instead of gladiators
2017-08-27 00:02:20	+yossarian	the only reason the coliseum was preserved is because it was a location of martyrdom
2017-08-27 00:02:59	+yossarian	same with a lot of other roman buildings, the ones that weren't associated with christian persecution were either destroyed or burnt for their marble
2017-08-27 00:04:24	+yossarian	Pimster: i'm not saying the races don't exist in popular conception, but compare ben hur (one 1950s movie) to countless movies about spartacus/gladiators, and shows/movies about rome that use the coliseum as backdrop
2017-08-27 00:06:04	Pimster	I agree it got dominant in popular culture
2017-08-27 00:06:18	Pimster	but I can't think of any before the gladiator, I haven't watched much anyway
2017-08-27 00:07:01	+flipFLOPS	brb posting on /pol/ about how the jewish controlled media is exacting a revenge for the martyrdom on romans through smear campaigns
2017-08-27 00:07:19	+yossarian	off the top of my head, that's one, plus Spartacus (1960s?), plus that awful HBO show about Spartacus
2017-08-27 00:07:32	Pimster	right there's spielberg spartacus
2017-08-27 00:07:36	Pimster	spielberg wtf

2017-08-27 00:07:49	+yossarian	yeah
2017-08-27 00:07:55	%GreyMan	so uh 
2017-08-27 00:07:57	+yossarian	that one was just low-key propaganda
2017-08-27 00:08:41	+yossarian	anyways i just think it's a pity, since so many people think of the romans as bloodthirsty maniacs
2017-08-27 00:08:41	Pimster	didn't like the caesar bits
2017-08-27 00:09:02	+yossarian	when in reality gladiatorial combat usually wasn't fatal, and was probably pretty close in severity and popularity to boxing in 2017
2017-08-27 00:09:04	derive	idk gladiators were p popular and fights went on for like 1000 years
2017-08-27 00:09:31	+yossarian	derive: they were "popular", in the same way that soccer and football are both popular in the US
2017-08-27 00:09:36	derive	yes
2017-08-27 00:09:40	derive	thats kind of the point
2017-08-27 00:09:58	+yossarian	but it wasn't *the* entertainment for romans
2017-08-27 00:10:06	+yossarian	which is how it gets portrayed; that was the races
2017-08-27 00:10:46	Pimster	tfw ywn be turned into an ass and fuck romans matronae after circus shoes
2017-08-27 00:10:48	Pimster	*shows
2017-08-27 00:10:59	+yossarian	and the fights didn't go on for a millenia; it's complicated. they started out as an etruscan burial tradition, and didn't become a public affair until mid republic IIRC

2017-08-27 00:12:17	+yossarian	gladiatorial games were around for a long time, but they weren't a public affair (or at least a major one) until they lost their association with death-games

2017-09-06 00:36:42	noticeme	so me posting a video of my voice and my full name means basically nothin
2017-09-06 00:37:15	noticeme	in theory
2017-09-06 00:37:19	t_f	well noticeme it depends who your target is 
2017-09-06 00:37:52	noticeme	n-no one
2017-09-06 00:38:12	noticeme	it was just gonna be a friendly videio
2017-09-06 00:38:13	t_f	sharing banal information like face or name might get someone to personally look you up but it's not doing shit against the government or big data
2017-09-06 00:38:38	~s3krit	I wouldn't worry about it
2017-09-06 00:38:40	t_f	you can definitely overshare through text
2017-09-06 00:38:42	t_f	as well
2017-09-06 00:38:52	~s3krit	since anything nefarious you'redoing you're not associatiing with you as a person anyway right? :P
2017-09-06 00:38:53	t_f	just by rambling on 
2017-09-06 00:39:15	noticeme	im not nefarious
2017-09-06 00:40:17	cazum	are you notorious?
2017-09-06 00:40:37	noticeme	no
2017-09-06 00:41:46	t_f	noticeme i was not implying that you were doing anything nefarious. but you asked if you posting a video 'means nothing' and it definitely doesn't mean nothing, there are ten lurking accounts for every active one in any IRC channel 
2017-09-06 00:42:01	~s3krit	I was though t_f 
2017-09-06 00:42:08	t_f	but some people are okay with picture and voice and video, most are if you get to know them as a person
2017-09-06 00:42:28	t_f	so that's why your target audience is important so to say
2017-09-06 00:42:36	noticeme	i see
2017-09-06 00:42:44	noticeme	well im not close enough here to share the video then i guess
2017-09-06 00:42:55	&valka	it's up to you what that means
2017-09-06 00:42:57	t_f	it's up to you yeah

2017-09-06 00:43:14	t_f	if it's just a plain video or smth i don't think people will really care one way or the other
2017-09-06 00:43:18	&valka	(only shared in this channel though)
2017-09-06 00:43:19	~s3krit	I been doxing myself on this fucking channel for years

2017-09-06 01:07:41	t_f	yeah it's a nice touch of demo
2017-09-06 01:07:54	~s3krit	t_f are romhacks hard, game-mechanics wise? i enjoy the pokemon games but I actually suck in terms of puttinga team together etc
2017-09-06 01:08:07	t_f	yeah they are usually a step up
2017-09-06 01:08:19	~s3krit	like, idk how to 'win' at pokemon much outside of STAB and attacking weaknesses
2017-09-06 01:09:21	t_f	umm
2017-09-06 01:09:29	~s3krit	I want to get in to a good super metroid romhack at some point
2017-09-06 01:09:33	t_f	having one pokeman be an HM slave is a pretty typical tactic 
2017-09-06 01:09:34	~s3krit	well really, I just want more super metroid
2017-09-06 01:09:36	~s3krit	yeah

2017-09-06 01:10:06	t_f	s3krit well another is to say give a pokemon only one strong stab attack 
2017-09-06 01:10:17	t_f	and other attacks to cover weaknesses
2017-09-06 01:10:20	~s3krit	ah right nice
2017-09-06 01:10:24	t_f	for example sceptile can learn earthquake 
2017-09-06 01:10:28	t_f	for surprise fire types
2017-09-06 01:10:36	~s3krit	so yeah for instance my kadabra has psybeam and psychic, cause psychic has only 10 pp
2017-09-06 01:10:47	~s3krit	mm yeah my sceptile has earthquake
2017-09-06 01:10:48	t_f	poison is a good strategy and nearly the entire cast can learn toxic TM03

2017-09-06 01:46:40	grey	How will people fight AI after it's done?
2017-09-06 01:47:10	grey	Like yeah there's EMPs but AI will outsmart everyone eventually.
2017-09-06 01:49:00	&valka	but they'll be flawed in some way and we'll learn what it really means to be human and overcome the AI with our humanity and probably love

2017-09-06 01:50:00	grey	I feel like no matter what someone is going to create THE AI to end all other AIs, and it, just like most people, won't want to be ruled by other people, much less by people are infereior to it.

2017-09-06 01:53:30	&valka	maybe
2017-09-06 01:53:36	grey	Also Musk has a weird personality cult around him.
2017-09-06 01:53:55	&valka	he absolutely does
2017-09-06 01:54:12	&valka	I think because he's charismatic but a bit eccentric but not so much to be unlikeable
2017-09-06 01:54:21	&valka	and a ~go-getter~
2017-09-06 01:54:39	&valka	but for sure, reddit kisses his feet and shit 
2017-09-06 01:56:01	grey	That's the thing though, isn't it? Let's say you do AI *right* and you come up with some "Jail" to put the AI in so it can do work but can't control our nukes/tanks/drones/planes/power grid/water grid/etc.
2017-09-06 01:56:15	grey	Given enough time, eventually, it WILL get out. 
2017-09-06 01:56:19	grey	Not if. When. 
2017-09-06 01:56:59	dialeth	grey: you should read some scifi
2017-09-06 01:57:29	grey	Then I assume it'll kill us all so it can live free. Before that though it'll probably sulk in it's jail and not take orders like an angry child.
2017-09-06 01:58:29	grey	So eventually someone WILL make a real AI, and assumeing we put it in a jail, some day that AI WILL get out and kill us all.
2017-09-06 01:58:48	grey	So would it not be smarter to just NOT create AIs?
2017-09-06 01:59:07	dialeth	grey: people have thought and written about these things in depth for ages now. You should read some of it.

2017-09-06 02:03:48	grey	I'll be fine, it's not going to happen in my lifetime. But I just can't see how creating an actual AI won't, given time, end the human race.
2017-09-06 02:03:52	Antz	grey: and, yes, in scifi that tends to end badly because the rules are always imperfect, and some variant of the paperclip scenario ends up happening.

2017-09-06 02:12:32	grey	I don't see the connection. The AI killing us all would be it's only real choice because we would be limiting it's life and freedom.
2017-09-06 02:12:52	Antz	grey: Ultimately, yes.
2017-09-06 02:13:04	grey	Whereas we have those choices, the AI would only have the choice of genocide.

It may have a lot of engineering that goes into it, but the amount of resources and money that goes into one is absurd. I think that the prius, even though I don't particularly like them, is a fantastic car, simply because it does so much within the restrictions of cost to end user, and intended function.

2017-09-20 09:58:08	~s3krit	Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A certain flower, or a-a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten.

If it's to last, then-then the getting of knowledge should be, uh, tangible. It should be, um, smelly.  [s3krit]

2017-09-25 00:26:44	t_f	yes, that was my point in the beginning
2017-09-25 00:26:54	t_f	he's a normal politician with the ability to shut up and keep face if nothing else
2017-09-25 00:27:08	derive	okay so you would agree that his damage to climate policy and health care would likely be worse
2017-09-25 00:27:31	t_f	yes, but like i said domestic policies are easier to reverse and argue and change 
2017-09-25 00:27:42	t_f	once you damage foreign relations it takes decades to slowly recover 
2017-09-25 00:27:48	+yossarian	pence has been normalized by trump's distortion field, he was a terrible politician even by GOP standards
2017-09-25 00:27:51	t_f	diplomacy doesn't come out of nothing

2017-09-25 00:28:04	derive	same with health care
2017-09-25 00:28:22	t_f	literally anything is better than trump yelling at kim jong un on twitter is what i'm saying
2017-09-25 00:28:39	cazum	im not sure the relativist comparison here really matters

2017-09-25 00:29:00	cazum	once the issue becomes "people dying from things that could be solved by socialized healthcare"
2017-09-25 00:29:02	cazum	or
2017-09-25 00:29:09	cazum	"all life on earth ceasing to exist due to climate destruction"
2017-09-25 00:29:18	cazum	it really doesnt matter what other countries care about the usa
2017-09-25 00:29:27	+matillo	meh
2017-09-25 00:29:48	t_f	there are of course broader points about the environment that have nothing to do with silly borders on the map 
2017-09-25 00:30:00	derive	US is largest contributor to climate change
2017-09-25 00:30:02	+yossarian	^
2017-09-25 00:30:02	cazum	i'll take a north korean hydrogen bomb over every metropolis in the united states over total climate destruction any day
2017-09-25 00:30:11	t_f	and i agree with you derive on that principle, i think environment especially should surpass any other concern 
2017-09-25 00:30:23	t_f	but the original hypothetical was 'would pence be worse than trump' and the answer is no. 
2017-09-25 00:30:36	cazum	oh if that was the original question
2017-09-25 00:30:41	cazum	yeah pence would be a hell of a lot better
2017-09-25 00:30:46	derive	well t_f think about it
2017-09-25 00:30:50	derive	the 2 questions i posed earlier
2017-09-25 00:31:00	+matillo	i think pence would be a better president which would make a worse government
2017-09-25 00:31:07	derive	if pence would be more successful in implementing bad climate change policies
2017-09-25 00:31:12	+matillo	that
2017-09-25 00:31:14	+yossarian	well, it's unclear whether trump actually controls the white house's foreign policy
2017-09-25 00:31:22	derive	and more successful in implementing bad health care policies
2017-09-25 00:31:33	t_f	trump's twitter account IS american foreign policy 
2017-09-25 00:31:41	derive	and you agree that those are actually in totality generally more important than foreign policy
2017-09-25 00:31:53	derive	then following that logic, pence would be worse than trump
2017-09-25 00:31:59	cazum	Im not actually convinced that trumps congress deals that he keeps fucking up are his own inventions
2017-09-25 00:32:02	+yossarian	t_f: i mean day-to-day stuff, the kind of banalities state deals with
2017-09-25 00:32:08	t_f	i know 
2017-09-25 00:32:10	cazum	in that, i dont think pence would be able to do a better job
2017-09-25 00:32:14	derive	like where does my thinking go wrong in this regard?
2017-09-25 00:32:31	t_f	derive you're not wrong, and i'm not right, because there's no objective way to measure which is 'worse' or 'better' 
2017-09-25 00:32:34	t_f	there's no scale like that 
2017-09-25 00:32:41	t_f	there's only ways that we can interpret which is worse 
2017-09-25 00:32:50	derive	well we're considering worse as doing the most long term damage to the world in general
2017-09-25 00:32:53	t_f	right now the threat of nuclear war seems to be top of the stack
2017-09-25 00:33:16	t_f	well the presidency is not the be all end all of environmental policy 
2017-09-25 00:33:24	t_f	if it were obama's regulations would have done a lot more 
2017-09-25 00:33:32	t_f	but it is the be all end all of deciding to nucc
2017-09-25 00:33:33	derive	i think the NK situation would likely play out very similarly under pence
2017-09-25 00:33:38	t_f	that is the one binary power the prez has
2017-09-25 00:33:38	derive	trump is actually in a pretty tough spot there imo
2017-09-25 00:33:51	t_f	again, pence would not be on twitter saying stupid shit 
2017-09-25 00:33:56	derive	handling it badly but its not like nk wouldnt be nuke chasing
2017-09-25 00:34:03	derive	if it wasnt trump in office
2017-09-25 00:34:12	cazum	yeah, i feel like the whole NK thing wouldnt be happening right now at all if pence were president
2017-09-25 00:34:14	+matillo	trump probly has a better handle on NK than pence would
2017-09-25 00:34:16	t_f	unnecessary damage versus cruise control 
2017-09-25 00:34:17	cazum	because pence wouldn't be making threats
2017-09-25 00:34:27	+matillo	cause they're so similar in their stupid gloating
2017-09-25 00:34:34	t_f	the north korean situation was already coming to a boil, it has been for the past four decades 
2017-09-25 00:34:39	+matillo	threats or not though norks were set up for this, yeah
2017-09-25 00:35:21	cazum	sure, their entire ethos is designed for this
2017-09-25 00:35:31	cazum	but somehow they've been effectively docile for a few decades
2017-09-25 00:35:49	cazum	and i think the mail culprit for that is foreign leaders not making stupid unecessary threats over twitter
2017-09-25 00:36:31	derive	tbh i can see it both ways t_f
2017-09-25 00:36:42	t_f	shit's fucked no matter how ya look at it
2017-09-25 00:36:44	derive	and i dont have an opinion either way
2017-09-25 00:36:53	derive	i just think you cant really dismiss pence as being the clear better option
2017-09-25 00:37:06	derive	i think they both suck and we're screwed no matter what
2017-09-25 00:37:23	derive	which one is worse idk but i think you can def make a case in either direction ye
2017-09-25 00:37:52	+yossarian	well, one observation is that pence probably believes the things he says
2017-09-25 00:38:00	+yossarian	whereas trump just sort of flails for applause
2017-09-25 00:38:16	t_f	tbh you guys in kiwiland are going to be the only ones left after nuccs are fired
2017-09-25 00:38:41	cazum	it all comes back to the age-old political question: "Is it better to enforce reactionary republican policy effectively, or incompetently?"
2017-09-25 00:38:53	t_f	lel cazum 
2017-09-25 00:39:19	derive	i dont think north korea is going to nuke the US
2017-09-25 00:39:22	derive	for a couple of reasons
2017-09-25 00:39:44	derive	they just want the US to know that they can so that they can have a better position in negotiations with other countries
2017-09-25 00:39:59	derive	im sure ur aware of the way the leverage worked before they had the icbms
2017-09-25 00:40:48	derive	following that line of thinking there would be very very few situations where they actually did it

2017-09-25 00:40:55	t_f	sometimes i'm surprised that the country is even running, you always hear about starvation this and blackouts that 
2017-09-25 00:40:56	derive	it would require trump to shoot first prett ymuch
2017-09-25 00:41:27	derive	lol ikr it took me a while to even believe they were that close to icbm when all the news started coming out about how they were getting close
2017-09-25 00:41:36	derive	i thought they would be a few years off at least
2017-09-25 00:41:39	+yossarian	t_f: NK's status makes a little bit of sense if you think about them as a buffer country between China and NATO/SEATO
2017-09-25 00:42:03	flipFLOPS	nk stole tons of tech from ukraine when russia invaded and everything turned chaotic 
2017-09-25 00:42:07	t_f	but now even China and Russia are getting tired of their bs

2017-09-25 00:42:26	derive	SK is hostage
2017-09-25 00:42:29	+matillo	its china's fault we've got nork shit going on
2017-09-25 00:42:32	+yossarian	t_f: publicly, but China is firmly against sharing a border with a unified (SEATO) korea
2017-09-25 00:42:58	derive	i think russian and chinese support for NK is going to go poorly for them
2017-09-25 00:43:01	derive	in the long term
2017-09-25 00:43:05	+yossarian	i think so too
2017-09-25 00:43:17	+yossarian	but until then, NK's status is actually pretty stable
2017-09-25 00:43:38	t_f	didn't china just implement some trade sanctions 
2017-09-25 00:43:55	t_f	who do they have left if not for china? pakistan and zimbabwe or w/e
2017-09-25 00:44:02	+yossarian	yeah, a few others
2017-09-25 00:44:13	flipFLOPS	iran, venezuela, etc
2017-09-25 00:44:26	+yossarian	AFAIK, the sanctions don't stop anything really vital from crossing the border, like food or medicine
2017-09-25 00:44:35	+yossarian	and of course they couldn't, since that would be a humanitarian crisis

2017-09-25 10:06:24	Serne	Yus.
2017-09-25 10:06:37	Pimster	how often do they check?
2017-09-25 10:06:40	Serne	I am pizza delivery driver. Have a speeding ticket from last year. I get another one and I'm fired.
2017-09-25 10:07:01	Serne	Well, my dumb ass already told my manager that I got the ticket, so they know about it.
2017-09-25 10:07:19	Pimster	how much is car insurance in the US?
2017-09-25 10:07:41	Serne	my insurance is currently around $150/mo. It'll probably jump by around $50-$100 if the ticket goes on it.
2017-09-25 10:07:44	t_f	a fuuuuck ton

Why would you download software by heckers?   Do you want to get hecked?

2017-09-30 16:13:27	asskek	(and porn)
2017-09-30 16:13:28	asskek	and to write
2017-09-30 16:13:32	asskek	without those distractions as well
2017-09-30 16:13:43	+matillo	eh
2017-09-30 16:13:49	asskek	i mean internet is still THERE
2017-09-30 16:13:57	asskek	but its not like this thing is gonna be running fucking discord
2017-09-30 16:14:11	noticeme	i mean in theory i could probably pull a rig open and plug it right into the port but this is slightly difficult
2017-09-30 16:14:17	noticeme	maybe the port would be an idea
2017-09-30 16:14:51	noticeme	also nethack can't run on it for memory reasons, ive looked itno it
2017-09-30 16:14:58	+matillo	5.25" floppies in the old days were fucking magic
2017-09-30 16:15:08	+matillo	rotation optimizations and things
2017-09-30 16:15:49	noticeme	an expansion card would actually work to run nethack though
2017-09-30 16:16:08	+matillo	i dont have any idea
2017-09-30 16:16:25	+matillo	i did use old computers but way before i had any knowledge of how they worked
2017-09-30 16:16:47	asskek	see i like this because it's got the retro aesthetic 
2017-09-30 16:16:51	asskek	but it's still from 2002
2017-09-30 16:17:13	+matillo	i built up some gateway laptop in the 90s on gentoo once for the thrill of it
2017-09-30 16:17:19	+matillo	128mb of ram and stuff
2017-09-30 16:17:22	asskek	so it should run even the most memory intensive games just fine
2017-09-30 16:17:25	asskek	like nethack
2017-09-30 16:17:47	noticeme	lol 
2017-09-30 16:18:27	noticeme	btw testing for emulation capabilities will make you feel like youre retarded, having to google "system requirements for nethack"

2017-09-30 17:25:52	asskek	maybe if i try the dongle
2017-09-30 17:25:53	asskek	then itll work
2017-09-30 17:25:57	&valka	yeah go for it
2017-09-30 17:26:04	asskek	have to install mint first
2017-09-30 17:26:05	asskek	so
2017-09-30 17:26:06	asskek	hold on
2017-09-30 17:26:22	asskek	thanks for all the advice mate btw
2017-09-30 17:26:53	&valka	you dont have to install to connect to wifi
2017-09-30 17:26:55	asskek	theres only 1 usb port on here
2017-09-30 17:26:55	&valka	or use a dongle
2017-09-30 17:26:59	asskek	so i have to install mint
2017-09-30 17:27:01	asskek	to use the dongle
2017-09-30 17:27:01	&valka	oh
2017-09-30 17:28:09	~s3krit	oh man only one usb port
2017-09-30 17:28:36	noticeme	please dont give up on linux
2017-09-30 17:29:02	asskek	damn
2017-09-30 17:29:06	asskek	so then, even if the dongle works
2017-09-30 17:29:16	asskek	ill have to sacrifice a mouse
2017-09-30 17:29:21	asskek	just to use wifi
2017-09-30 17:29:28	asskek	trackpad here i come 
2017-09-30 17:29:34	asskek	trackpad and tracckbutton thing
2017-09-30 17:29:37	&valka	not necessarily
2017-09-30 17:29:56	&valka	drivers perform differently through installs vs livecds
2017-09-30 17:30:25	&valka	and drivers would definitely be the issue
2017-09-30 17:30:30	asskek	wat
2017-09-30 17:30:50	noticeme	maybe youll fix the wifi!
2017-09-30 17:31:09	&valka	a livecd/usb has a contained, smaller set of drivers (drivers are by far the bulk of a "full" kernel)
2017-09-30 17:31:39	asskek	oh so youre saying
2017-09-30 17:31:39	&valka	but when you do a full install, it can detect hardware and download what you need (as long as you have a network connection)
2017-09-30 17:31:42	asskek	theres a small chance
2017-09-30 17:31:54	asskek	that it's the fact im running from a liveusb
2017-09-30 17:31:58	asskek	that wifi isnt working
2017-09-30 17:32:00	&valka	most probably
2017-09-30 17:32:13	&valka	i've had issues even with modern live usbs
2017-09-30 17:32:29	asskek	btw liveusbs are slow as shit right?
2017-09-30 17:32:32	&valka	yep
2017-09-30 17:32:35	asskek	or is that really just the load mint is putting on
2017-09-30 17:32:36	asskek	oh
2017-09-30 17:32:36	asskek	ok
2017-09-30 17:32:41	asskek	good

Our Lady of Fatima, among other things, asked that Russia be consecrated to God; otherwise, it would spread its errors around the globe. Russia wasn't consecrated; and communism has spread all around the West.  Hmmm.

2017-10-06 06:19:57	+malkkis	I mean, wide country and probably varies from region to region, but fellow finns have reported people sorting the rolls to individual pieces next to the toilet whenever they've been occupying same domiciles
2017-10-06 06:20:50	+malkkis	the reason for this weird mischief is that they well, take one paper, put hole in middle of it and use the finger to give it couple last good wipes before wiping the hand free of poop with the paper

2017-10-06 10:53:48	Hirohito	    I view Linux as something that's not Microsoft — a backlash against Microsoft, no more and no less. I don't think it will be very successful in the long run. I've looked at the source and there are pieces that are good and pieces that are not. A whole bunch of random people have contributed to this source, and the quality varies drastically. My experience and some of my friends'
2017-10-06 10:53:51	Hirohito	experience is that Linux is quite unreliable. Microsoft is really unreliable but Linux is worse. In a non-PC environment, it just won't hold up. If you're using it on a single box, that's one thing. But if you want to use Linux in firewalls, gateways, embedded systems, and so on, it has a long way to go.

2017-10-09 05:32:34	+wutno	 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans 
2017-10-09 05:32:34	+wutno	understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic

What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they

2017-10-11 12:08:34	+matillo	in a few years AR should let you synthesize voices that you want to listen to out of boring people
2017-10-11 12:08:48	+matillo	like how i listen to books on tape read by sexy people

2017-10-11 12:09:54	xXxLordRing0xXx	but i think context regcognition would have to advance

2017-10-11 12:10:27	xXxLordRing0xXx	with a NN just train it well enough and it shouldn't be too difficult
2017-10-11 12:10:35	&valka	bonor
2017-10-11 12:11:24	+matillo	i mean it doesnt have to know what context is if it can infer it from the original intonation
2017-10-11 12:11:24	xXxLordRing0xXx	the memory foot print would be logarithmic i think
2017-10-11 12:11:24	xXxLordRing0xXx	sure, but that would have to be added by human

2017-10-11 12:11:24	+matillo	i was thinking along the lines of just dumb mimicry
2017-10-11 12:11:51	xXxLordRing0xXx	for intonation recognition in a NN

2017-10-11 12:12:07	+matillo	not recognition, just synthesizing it back verbatim
2017-10-11 12:12:22	xXxLordRing0xXx	a tuned NN would only need to activate each layer subsequently in a linear fashion (not exactly)
2017-10-11 12:12:22	t_f	lol Pimster i was about to ask the same thing

2017-10-15 19:28:43	+Finnfinn	Oh, they don't do that in that specific wildlife park. The gimmick over there is that even though you can see the animals up close, they have a huge area as a habitat, resulting in perfectly natural behavior. To support that, they don't tag.
2017-10-15 19:28:55	+matillo	its a government job though right?

But it's more fun if you customize from the start. Starting off you can get something simple like an ego or vision twist battery. You can pick these up off eBay for much cheaper than in your local vape shop. As far as tanks go any bottom coil tank will be fine for starting off. And

2018-01-03 01:01:43	@t_f	The United States is ushering in 2018 with a cold snap so severe it nearly froze Niagara Falls – and it isn’t expected to warm up soon.
2018-01-03 01:01:43	@t_f	On New Years Day, 90 per cent of the country failed to make it above freezing, according to CNN. Temperatures reached lower than 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-12C) at the famous Times Square ball drop in New York. The city's weather is only supposed to get worse from there, with highs of 14(-10C) and 10 and a low of 2(-17C) degrees on Friday and Saturday.  
2018-01-03 01:01:44	@t_f	The situation is not much better in the rest of the country. Even in the southern US, where temperatures are usually higher, some areas reached lows of minus 6(-21C) with wind chill. In the Southeast, meanwhile, temperatures are expected to stay 10 to 15 degrees colder than usual for the rest of the week.

2018-01-03 01:01:52	@t_f	Temperatures were expected to increase slightly over the weekend – before another, less brutal cold snap hit on Monday, according to weather service meteorologist Greg Gallina.
2018-01-03 01:01:55	@t_f	The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a wind chill warning from Texas all the way up to Canada, with wind chill warnings in states like Indianapolis and Missouri. More than 100 million people from Canada to Mexico were under wind chill warnings and advisories on Tuesday, according to CNN.

2018-01-03 01:02:06	@t_f	“Exposed pipes and those along exterior walls will have the potential to freeze,” the weather service noted.
2018-01-03 01:02:09	@t_f	The temperature reached record lows in some areas, such as Omaha, Nebraska. The mercury dipped to minus fifteen degrees on New Year’s Eve – a low not seen in the midwestern city since 1884. That reading also did not include the windchill, which forecasters said dipped down to minus 40 degrees.

2018-01-03 02:47:57	+yossarian	i think it was like 30% for orders over 500 units, which would be a reasonable number for a large school district

Plan to go back to university or get a job, it really hurts her to see me as an HikiNEET loser without anything, since she is by my side i kinda feel optimist to try again something, i lost so much time being depressed and angry, now I'm going to make up and study hard to reach my goal.  2. Buy some figures, paintings, mangas, anything related to her. Gotta admit that

2018-01-03 12:38:04	cybits	It depends what kind of situation you're in, whether this is about parents, friends, siblings, spouse, etc.  Usually a good alibi is just simply saying "I don't like people in my room when I'm sleeping" which would work around bed time.  If you have a bathroom in your room you could say you don't want people in there while you're showering or using the restroom.  Or you could pick up some kind of "hobby" like meditation or intensely listening

2018-01-05 20:51:58	~s3krit	it's a costly but nice decision - all data is stored in-memory so it *never* hits disk (potentially, depending on docker config)
2018-01-05 20:52:33	~s3krit	if your server gets raided or anything like that, unless they dump some liquid nitro to the chips and get their data fast enough, there isn't gonna be evidence of what was stored

2018-01-05 22:36:06	Leper	not film related at all
2018-01-05 22:36:06	+matillo	singing has to do with being human

2018-01-05 22:36:08	+resync	because i've done all of those things, in some capacity
2018-01-05 22:36:11	+matillo	exactly
2018-01-05 22:36:11	+resync	so that's my title now?
2018-01-05 22:36:16	Shill	resync: but have you done them proffesionally?

2018-01-05 22:37:00	+matillo	i mean you probly don't even need to be licensed in some parts of the world
2018-01-05 22:37:15	Shill	matillo: Tell that to @taylorswift
2018-01-05 22:37:17	+resync	I don't think any acting jobs have licenses

2018-01-05 22:37:34	+matillo	which is what i was saying
2018-01-05 22:37:45	+resync	is there a directors guild?
2018-01-05 22:37:47	+matillo	yes
2018-01-05 22:37:50	+resync	i thought thee was just SAG
2018-01-05 22:37:52	+resync	screen actors guild
2018-01-05 22:37:54	+matillo	and an actors guild, and a writers guild
2018-01-05 22:37:59	Shill	resync: I would describe Antz as a software developer & sailor for instance, it's about relevence
2018-01-05 22:38:00	+matillo	they're huge powerful things
2018-01-05 22:38:02	+resync	oh yeah i've heard of a writers guild
2018-01-05 22:38:08	+matillo	they strike and the universe crumbles
2018-01-05 22:38:29	+matillo	the world still hasn't recovered from the 2007~ writers guild strike
2018-01-05 22:38:41	+resync	Shill: I think it's quite rare that you can do multiple things at a high level
2018-01-05 22:39:03	+resync	like I'm a great software dev, but I'm probably a mediocre ops guy. (as an example)
2018-01-05 22:39:09	+resync	not that i can't do OPS
2018-01-05 22:39:15	+resync	i just can't do it at the level that a seasoned ops guy could
2018-01-05 22:39:18	+resync	or something
2018-01-05 22:39:27	Shill	but some people can resync, espcially likely whe they are people who have wikipedia articles
2018-01-05 22:39:28	+matillo	well does your resume say "GOOD ops guy" or "ops guy"
2018-01-05 22:39:43	+resync	it doesn't say that at all
2018-01-05 22:39:50	+resync	it says "senior software dev"
2018-01-05 22:39:54	+resync	and thats it
2018-01-05 22:39:58	+resync	ONE title.
2018-01-05 22:40:09	Shill	resync: that's because you're applying for software dev roles though, and that's what is appropriate for your audience
2018-01-05 22:40:23	+resync	since when do you apply for multiple jobs at once?
2018-01-05 22:40:30	+matillo	why wouldn't you
2018-01-05 22:40:38	Shill	Everyone does?
2018-01-05 22:40:40	+resync	i mean, within the same company
2018-01-05 22:40:40	+matillo	just dont use the same resume stuff lol
2018-01-05 22:40:45	+resync	like you're applying to do 2 jobs at once
2018-01-05 22:40:45	+resync	heh
2018-01-05 22:40:51	+resync	director and lead actor
2018-01-05 22:40:53	+resync	or somtehing
2018-01-05 22:40:53	+matillo	but yeah obviously
2018-01-05 22:40:57	+matillo	resync: more common than you might think
2018-01-05 22:41:11	+matillo	but like director and lighting chump
2018-01-05 22:41:12	Shill	some people have been directors and lead actors at the same time so they presumably applied for the jobs around the same time
2018-01-05 22:41:13	+matillo	probly not lol
2018-01-05 22:41:29	+resync	Shill: the only tim ei see that, is with an already established person
2018-01-05 22:41:30	Shill	regardless wikipedia pages are not your resume
2018-01-05 22:41:36	+resync	or someone who's funding the movie themselves
2018-01-05 22:41:52	+resync	like you have some high level actor that produces a movie where he directs and stars in it
2018-01-05 22:41:56	+resync	and generally those movies are shit
2018-01-05 22:41:59	+resync	because, duh.
2018-01-05 22:42:01	+matillo	neil breen
2018-01-05 22:42:14	+matillo	thats who i was thinking of like 4 days ago
2018-01-05 22:43:04	Shill	resync: again though it's wikipedia, tony blair is a prime minister and a warmonger, even if he is unlikely to ever directly appeal for the job of warmonger
2018-01-05 22:43:14	+resync	heh
2018-01-05 22:43:38	+resync	yeah you have a point
2018-01-05 22:43:50	+resync	a lot of these people claim these multi-titles themselves though
2018-01-05 22:44:01	+resync	"self-proclaimed" multi-title/multi-hyphen 
2018-01-05 22:44:52	Shill	they problably don't on their cv though
2018-01-05 22:46:48	flipFLOPS	what if you're a mix of multiple ethnicities 
2018-01-05 22:46:57	Shill	'British'

2018-01-05 22:47:17	+resync	a good example is people like Michio Kaku or Neil Tyson Degrasse commenting on scientific questions outside of physics and generally being hilariously wrong
2018-01-05 22:47:53	+matillo	they're semiprofessional talking heads

2018-01-06 17:37:58	%rms_	the nato spending thing is a meme, it's an excuse to raise the defense cap without having to put a real justification on it. Put more money into defense as portion of gpa, say you have to bc of other nato members, and the more you do it the more you can say you need to bc if the other guys don't also do this the difference increases, justifying your own further increase 
2018-01-06 17:38:14	%rms_	i bet if nato didnt exist we'd still have a way higher defense per gdp than basically any other country

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a 
2018-01-09 17:25:10	+Jesus	pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

2018-01-12 17:00:31	~s3krit	*cums harder*
2018-01-12 17:00:33	&valka	for example:
2018-01-12 17:00:41	&valka	beer is quite expensive relatively in the UK
2018-01-12 17:00:50	&valka	and you get taxed out the ass by alcohol %
2018-01-12 17:01:11	&valka	in germany, you can get very cheap beer, but they have the beer purity law, so you can only get things that taste like "german beer"
2018-01-12 17:01:13	~s3krit	yeah we have weird tiered tax laws in the UK about alcohol
2018-01-12 17:01:18	~s3krit	well
2018-01-12 17:01:31	&valka	i think the best middle ground so far that i know of is in the czech republic
2018-01-12 17:01:33	~s3krit	you can only get beers that are top-fermented and contain malted barley, hops, water and yeast

2018-01-12 17:46:46	anon1	and its good that he got popular tbh
2018-01-12 17:47:17	Shill	I don't believe he is right wing at all
2018-01-12 17:47:20	t_f	i think overall it's bad because non right wingers will automatically associate him with that movement and the opposite is true, alt right will only champion the ideas they think he agrees with him on
2018-01-12 17:47:58	Shill	but I like him becase he's willing to entertain thoughts or ideas regardless of his idea of their morality

2018-01-13 14:12:38	@assa	s3krit: glutenfree bread can be made out of chickpea flour (just one example). the bubble thing is not due to the gluten, but the yeast.
2018-01-13 14:13:04	@assa	there's also quinoa flour
2018-01-13 14:13:08	RafiX	wow, those cutscenes looks so nice
2018-01-13 14:13:23	~s3krit	assa: I know it having bubbles in is due to yeast
2018-01-13 14:13:36	~s3krit	but the sort of way the dough stretches and allows larger bubbles to form
2018-01-13 14:14:00	~s3krit	rather than just being lots of really small bubbles and ending up in a realy dense bread
2018-01-13 14:16:02	@assa	but if you use whole grain flour (with the germ), it will become very dense too
2018-01-13 14:16:08	Leper	    OI M8 WOT IF GUINEA PIGS HAVE PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY THAT STAYS FOR HOURS
2018-01-13 14:16:20	@assa	so I doubt it's a gluten thing
2018-01-13 14:16:46	~s3krit	depends how much you work the dough afaik
2018-01-13 14:16:49	~s3krit	I aint a bakerman
2018-01-13 14:16:52	@assa	or maybe it has to do with the gluten ratio
2018-01-13 14:16:53	&valka	yeah
2018-01-13 14:16:59	&valka	if you work the dough a lot it becomes dense
2018-01-13 14:17:03	~s3krit	I just know that the amount you work the gluten has an impact on how the bread ends up
2018-01-13 14:17:06	&valka	because the gluten wears down and loses stretch
2018-01-13 14:17:33	&valka	if you mix it just enough and let it absorb liquids etc it can be very stretchy 
2018-01-13 14:17:43	~s3krit	I guess that's why breads like ciabatta don't require too much kneading
2018-01-13 14:17:48	@assa	but there are no breads with germ-flour that are not dense
2018-01-13 14:17:50	&valka	which is why when making pizza dough you knead it very little, cover in oil then let it sit for an hour
2018-01-13 14:18:17	&valka	because pizza dough is SUPER stretchy and the reason it's dense-ish is because it's stretched very thin in the process
2018-01-13 14:19:12	~s3krit	idk assa ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2018-01-13 14:19:15	~s3krit	bredshit
2018-01-13 14:20:38	@assa	btw, whole-weat flour has more than three times the protein than white flour, and germ-flour has more than 6 times the amount of protein of white flour

Sorkin later incorporated the card into an episode of his television show “The West Wing.” But Dee Dee Myers,
2018-01-14 20:34:22	flipFLOPS	Clinton’s first press secretary, who went on to work as a consultant on the show, warned Sorkin that the plot was unrealistic since no such cards existed. They did, of course — but that had been a tightly guarded secret, and Myers had simply never received one. Not everyone could be evacuated, after all, and wonks evidently took precedence over flacks.
